# JS-Class-Project1 - CivicMemory
This is a memory game where you are presented with a set of cards that are face down. Click on two cards to reveal their images. If the two cards match, the cards will remain face up. If the cards do not match they will return to their face down positions. Repeat until all cards are face up.
